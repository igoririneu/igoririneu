Hey, I'm Igor 👋</h1>

I am just beginning my career in this incredible area of technology in which the constant innovations and challenges in the area fascinate me a lot and this makes me increasingly thirsty for information. <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Developer.gif" width="30px">

I am currently graduating in Systems Analysis and Development from Faculdade Impacta Tecnologia, which is based on Python, and taking a FullStack Developer course, I do not qualify in the Front-end part yet, studying JavaScript, HTML 5 and CSS 3.
