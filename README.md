Hey, I'm Igor 👋</h1>

I am just beginning my career in this incredible area of technology in which the constant innovations and challenges in the area fascinate me a lot and this makes me increasingly thirsty for information. <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Developer.gif" width="30px">

I am currently graduating in Systems Analysis and Development from <a href="https://www.impacta.edu.br/">Faculdade Impacta Tecnologia</a>, which is based on Python, and taking a FullStack Developer course, in which I am still in the Front-end part, studying JavaScript, HTML 5 and CSS 3.
I want to know more about the endless possibilities of my career, because of this I am open to opportunities in search of an internship that provides challenges and learning. <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Rocket.gif" width="18px">
